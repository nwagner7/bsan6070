CA04 Ð Ensemble ModelsAssignment OverviewIn this assignment, a Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, and XGB model are created and trained in order to conduct a data analysis on the census data file. The accuracy and AUC score of each model was identified and recorded to compare the performance of each model. These findings can be very useful to a data analyst in order to recognize which model is most reliable and effective.Configuration/Installation InstructionsThis code was executed using a GoogleColab notebook. The data is given in the Brightspace folder and can be found at this link: https://brightspace.lmu.edu/d2l/le/content/132718/viewContent/1479978/ViewFiles IncludedThis assignment includes a GoogleColab notebook ipynb file, a PDF file discussing the findings from the analysis, and a README file.Known BugsThere are no known bugs in the code.
