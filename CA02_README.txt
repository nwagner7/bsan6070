CA02 - Naive Bayes
Assignment Overview
This is the second Computer Assignment for BSAN 6070 Intro to Machine Learning course. In this assignment, we trained a model with a set of emailed labelled as either Spam or Not Spam. There are 702 emails equally divided into spam and non spam categories. The next step was to test the model on 260 emails. The model then predicted the category of emails and compared the accuracy with correct classification. Three alternative Naive Bayes models were tested: Gaussian, Multinomial, and Bernoulli.
