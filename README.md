# BSAN6070 - All CAs will be posted in this repository
CA01 - EDA India Pollution
Assignment Overview
This is the first Computer Assignment for BSAN 6070 Intro to Machine Learning course. The assignment involves using exploratory data analysis to analyze a dataset with information regarding India's air quality. The data is released by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Central Pollution Control Board of India. The dataset was found on Kaggle (link: https://www.kaggle.com/shrutibhargava94/india-air-quality-data)
Configuration/Installation Instructions
There are no major configuration or installation instructions. Jupyter Notebook was used to complete this assignment, however the code and execution of the code can be seen here on GitHub. 
List of Files Included
The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/shrutibhargava94/india-air-quality-data) and saved as a csv utf-8 file. This file was then uploaded to Jupyter.

CA02 - Naive Bayes
Assignment Overview
This is the second Computer Assignment for BSAN 6070 Intro to Machine Learning course. In this assignment, we trained a model with a set of emailed labelled as either Spam or Not Spam. There are 702 emails equally divided into spam and non spam categories. The next step was to test the model on 260 emails. The model then predicted the category of emails and compared the accuracy with correct classification. Three alternative Naive Bayes models were tested: Gaussian, Multinomial, and Bernoulli. The data can be downloaded from GitHub at this link: https://github.com/ArinB/MSBA-CA01-Spam-Mail-Naibe-Bayes
Configuration/Installation Instructions
Google Colab was used for this assignment. Files from Google Drive were used for the data and can be found at the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1u7iKwIEeBnJyvtNAT9FsBCeoSuNUaFvn?usp=sharing
List of Files Included
The files of data can be found at the Google Drive link above.

CA 03 - Decision Tree Algorithm
Assignment Overview
In this assignment, decision trees were trained, tested, and visualized to identify the best fitting model. The data was provided in the Brightspace assignment folder for CA03.
Configuration/Installation Instructions
This project was run on Google Colab. Several packages must be imported, which can be found inside the notebook. 
Files Included
This assignment contains an ipynb file, a README file, and a pdf document answering the written portion of the assignment.
Known Bugs
In section 6, the code to identify the AUC value does not execute correctly. It is unknown what the issue is, as the code for the other performance scores executes correctly.
